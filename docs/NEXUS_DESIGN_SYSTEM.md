# Nexus Design System üé®

## Introduction
The Nexus Design System is a comprehensive UI/UX framework designed to create consistent, scalable, and beautiful applications. Following the atomic design methodology, it breaks down interfaces into fundamental building blocks that combine to create sophisticated user experiences. üèóÔ∏è

### Key Principles
- **Consistency** üîÑ: Unified look and feel across all components
- **Flexibility** üí´: Adaptable components for various use cases
- **Accessibility** ‚ôø: Inclusive design for all users
- **Performance** ‚ö°: Optimized for smooth user experience

## Foundational Elements
1. **Color** (App‚Äôs visual identity)  
   - Light Mode: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Feedback Error, Feedback Warning, Feedback Success, Background, Inverse  
   - Dark Mode: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Feedback Error, Feedback Warning, Feedback Success, Background, Inverse  
2. **Typography** (Text styling)  
   - Font Family, Sizes, Weights  
3. **Spacing & Corners** (Layout and shape)  
   - Spacing: xs, s, m, l (padding/margins)  
   - Corners: Sharp, Smooth, Rounded (edge styles)  

## Atomic Components
1. **Basic Inputs** (Core UI elements)  
   - Text (labels), Button (actions), Input Text Field (user input), Icon (visual cues), Link (navigation)  
2. **Selection Controls** (User choices)  
   - Checkbox (multi-select), Radio Button (single-select), Toggle Switch (on/off), Dropdown (list picker)  
3. **Indicators & Decorators** (Visual enhancements)  
   - Avatar (user pics), Badge (notifications), Progress Bar (task status), Tooltip (hints), Shimmer Shapes (loading), Image (media)  

## Molecular Components
1. **Navigation & Selection** (UI navigation)  
   - Selectable Chip (filters), Fixed Tabs (static), Scrollable Tabs (dynamic)  
2. **Content Display** (Content presentation)  
   - Media Carousal (image slideshow), Content Carousal (text/info), Expandable Card (collapsible)  
3. **Dialogs & Notifications** (Overlays)  
   - Center Dialog (modals), BottomSheet Dialog (bottom-up), Snackbar (alerts)  
4. **Interactive Controls** (Dynamic inputs)  
   - Date Picker (calendar), Time Picker (clock), Slider Bar (range)  

## Organisms
1. **App Navigation** (Structure)  
   - Top Header Bar (title/actions), Bottom Navigation Bar (routes), Side Drawer (menu), Search Bar (filter)  
2. **Interactive Layouts** (Dynamic blocks)  
   - Single Level Accordion (expandable), Collapsible FAB (hidden actions), Exploding FAB (multi-action)  
3. **Data Visualization** (Analytics)  
   - Line Graph View (trends), Bar Graph View (comparisons), Pie Chart View (proportions)

### Component Hierarchy
| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Atoms | Basic building blocks | Buttons, Inputs, Icons |
| Molecules | Simple component groups | Navigation tabs, Cards |
| Organisms | Complex UI sections | Headers, Data visualizations |

### Theme Support üåì
The design system supports both light and dark themes with carefully selected color palettes:

| Mode | Primary Uses | Benefits |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Light | Day usage, High contrast needs | Better readability in bright environments |
| Dark | Night usage, Low light conditions | Reduced eye strain, Modern aesthetic |
